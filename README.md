- Integrated machine learning (Random Forest Regression) for predicting stock prices, enhancing the accuracy of the portfolio optimization process.
- Utilized Yahoo Finance library to collect data from global stock exchanges, and Scikit-learn to develop and refine the predictive model.
- Applied model validation techniques to ensure the model's accuracy and applicability across various financial scenarios.

## Libraries
